           <h1> <em> Kundli dosha</em></h1>
           <p>You must have heard of the Kundli Doshas once in your life. They are ominous and universal, and there is a lot of fear around them. However, once you have some understanding, the fear of the unknown is eliminated and what you are left with is the knowledge of how to tackle it. Today, we are doing just that! Here, we are trying to understand what is a Kundli dosh, their different types, and most important of them all, the remedies for those particular Doshas you might have in your Kundli.</p>

            <h1> <em> What is a Dosha in kundli ? </em> </h1>
            <p> Kundali Doshas are the flaws or defects or unfavorable conditions in a native’s horoscope. These are formed due to the unfavorable positioning of the planets in the twelve astrological houses of the Birth Chart. Doshas also occur due to the bad influence of malefic planets or zodiac sign or ascendant under it or the weak or debilitated planets in the Kundli. It is believed that Doshas appears as a result of bad Karmas of the present and previous birth.</p>
            <p> The planet Mars causes most of the doshas. Even we can say that it is accountable for cent percent available doshas. Besides, there are other planets—Rahu, Saturn, and Sun—that form dosha according to Vedic astrology. Rahu is responsible for 25% of the Vedic astrology dosha, Sun for 50%, and Saturn for 75% of all the dosha. </p>

            <h1> <em>  Different Types Of Doshas And Their Time Period </em> </h1>
            <p>There can be different types of Doshas present in a Kundli. Each Dosha is caused by specific planets for a specific time duration. Some Doshas occur for a shorter period while some affect native’s life for a longer period of time. The main Kundali Doshas that are found in a horoscope are: </p>
           
        

        <h3> 1: Mangal Dosh</h3>
        <p> Mangal Dosha or Kuja Dosha is caused by the planet Mars. It occurs when Mars positioned in the 1, 4, 7, 8, or 12th house of the Birth Chart. A person affected by this Dosha is referred to as a Manglik. Presence of Mangal Dosha in the natal chart causes delayed marriage, disturbances and quarrels in married life, divorce, or separation, or even death. 50% of people have Mangal Dosha in their Kundli. </p>
    
        <h3>   2: KaalSarp Dosha</h3>
         <p> This is the most dreadful Kundli Doshas that is feared by everyone. Kaal Sarp Dosha occurs when all the seven planets are placed between Rahu and Ketu. The time period of Kaal Sarp Dosha is usually 47 years depending upon an individual’s natal chart. Due to Kaal Sarp Dosha, one may suffer with marital issues, delay in success, constant obstacles, family conflicts, nightmares, ill-health, small life-span, financial problems, money loss, low self-esteem, betrayal, incurable diseases, career hurdles, lack of peace and happiness. </p>
       
       <h3> 3: Pitra Dosha</h3>
        <p> This Dosha occurs Saturn or Rahu is present in the single zodiac sign of the Kundli. As per astrologers, this Dosha appears when an individual or his forefathers had been cursed in the past life due to wrong deeds. It may cause pain and agony in life.</p>
       
        <h3>  4: Nadi Dosha</h3> 
       <p> Nadi Dosha occurs when an individual marries with the same Nadi person. People having Nadi Doshas may have unhealthy and weak children. Such natives may have troubled married life, thus, it is important to identify or check Nadi Dosha in the Kundli. </p>
      
      
      
        <h3>  5: Guru Chandal Dosh</h3>
        <p> Guru or Jupiter is the most auspicious planets that rules wisdom, education, kids, knowledge, treasury and wealth.</p>

          <p> Hence, Guru must be powerful in the birth chart to have knowledge, education, kids and wealth.</p>
            
          <p> If the planet Guru conjoined with the malefic Rahu and Ketu, Guru Chandal Yoga happens.</p>
        
        
        <h3>  6: Grahan Dosh</h3>
        <p>  Grahan Dosh is also a powerful nefarious Graha Dosh that can harm you to a great extent. The Grahan Dosh happens when you are born with the Sun and Moon in conjunction with Rahu and Ketu. </p>
        <p> Grahan Dosh also happens when you were born when Solar or Lunar eclipse happened.  </p>
        
        <h3>  7: Gandamool Dosh</h3>
        <p> ou must be aware of the Gandamool Graha Dosh  that might have happened to you or one of your relatives. The people are fearful of Gandmool Dosh as it harms a lot and makes the life not only slow but also struggling.  </p>
        <p> The Gandamool Dosh becomes more dangerous when other planets in the chart becomes malefic  </p>
       
       
        <h3>  8: Shani Dosh</h3>
        <p> The Shani Dosh is one of the most dreaded Graha Dosh that every one fears. The planet Shani can be harmful in many ways. However, you should not be fearful of Shani. </p>
        <p> The planet Saturn is the ruler of justice. The Shani punishes when you have done some wrong doing in life </p>
        <p> Shani Dosh can be different at different time. The most known Shani Doshas are Shani Sade Shati, Shani Dheya and Shani Mahadasha. </p>
        <p> Of course, the Shani Mahadasha, Shani Sade Sati and Dheya can be harmful when the planet Shani is malefic in the birth chart </p>
        <p> Hence, it is very important to know the strength of the Shani before getting into conclusion. If the planet Shani is exalted, own signed and Yoga Karak, then Shani will not be harmful. </p>
        <p> If Shani is Marak and moving over 12th, 1st and 2nd house in the transit, then it will harm severely. Similarly, bad Mahadasha of Shani can have detrimental effect on you when it is weak and afflicted by Sun, Mars, Rahu and Ketu </p>
               
        <h3>  9: Shrapit Dosh</h3>
         <p> In the Vedic astrology, there are many auspicious and inauspicious yogas happen in the birth chart. The Shrapit Dosh is one of the Dosh that embarrasses the native to a great extent. This Yoga synonymously called as Shrapit Yoga.  </p>
         
         <h3>  10: Kemadruma dosh</h3>
         <p>  Kemadruma Yoga is one of the most significant Yogas in the Indian Vedic astrology. According to Brihat Jatak by prolific writer Varah Mihir, Kemadruma Yoga happens when both side of the Moon in the birth chart is vacant.</p>
         <p>  In a nutshell, if the 2nd house and 12th house from the Moon is free from any planets, then this yoga takes place.</p>
         
         <h3>  11:Chandra Dosh </h3>
         <p>  The Chandra Dosh happens when the planet Moon conjoined with Rahu. Such condition of the Moon is also called Chandra Grahan.</p>
        <p> Life is a struggle and we have to face it. Sometimes struggle crosses the limits and it becomes beyond tolerance.  </p>
        <p>   You have been earning money. However, you don’t have clue where the money goes. You are extremely frustrated and depressed. The unwanted thoughts and fears becomes the part of your life. The road to success and source of income touches dead end. </p>
        <p>  The root cause of these problems could be Chandra Dosh. </p>
        <p> As we know, Moon or Chandrama plays an important role in predictive astrology, it is very important that the Moon should be powerful and your natal chart is free from Chandra Dosh. </p>

            <em>Remedies for Kundli Dosha </em> 
          </h1>
          <h4> I discourage people from running to know what Poojas , rituals, danam, havan etc. are to be performed to deal with Dosha. As explained, Doshas are a result of your own deeds in the previous life(s), and the best remedy is to sit in front of Almighty and take a Sankalp (pledge) by reciting relevant Mantras praying that you should come out from your miseries. Give your soul, mind & faith to Divine Power instead of showing Money Power. </4>
            
          <h4> See a small example: With a Pitra Dosha in Kundli, we donate, perform all types of rituals during Pitra Paksha but, on the other hand, do not give respect to our parents. You think Pitra Dosha will go. No, You do the first thing to substantiate the second, it is fine, but if you cannot change the second trait, no ritual or remedies can help you.</h4>
          
          <h4> The best remedy to pacify Dosha is Karma Correction. Also, let me tell you that each Horoscope has both Positive Yoga and Negative Dosha, but nothing either blesses you or curses you automatically. We should learn how to keep so accumulated Negative Dosha de-activated and how to activate Positive Yogas to reap its fruits. This is what the basic doctrine of Indian Astrology is.</h4>
