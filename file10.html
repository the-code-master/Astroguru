        </h3>
        <div class="intro">
            Tarot reading—also known as tarot card reading—is a form of divination in which psychics interpret tarot
            cards to give you insight into your future and guidance about the right path to take

            <p class="intro-para">
                Chances are, you've found this page for good reason: You've just picked up a Tarot deck, perhaps your
                first. You've spent some time flipping and familiarizing, and are ready to put them to use. This is an
                exciting undertaking—insight into your past, present, and even factors influencing your future can all
                be found in the cards.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p class="para1">
            You may be a bit confused or overwhelmed. There are lots of cards to master (we'll get to that in a moment),
            and if you've read the booklet that came in the company of your deck, you're likely feeling only slightly
            closer to becoming the intuitive that you know you are.


        </p>
        <p class="para1">
            But, with Tarot, it's best to trade fear for trust. By the time you're done here, you'll feel much more
            comfortable shuffling, placing, and reading your cards.

            What is Tarot, Anyway?
        </p>
        <p class="para1">
            First, a bit of history—Tarot got its start as a card game in the 15th century. So while it may seem like
            reading cards is an ancient practice, the use of Tarot for divination really came into its own in the 18th
            century. Because the Tarot deals in archetypes (or universal symbols), the meanings of each card and the
            stories those meanings tell span culture, continent, and time.

            century. Because the Tarot deals in archetypes (or universal symbols), the meanings of each card and the
            stories those meanings tell span culture, continent, and time.</p>

        <p class="para1 subhead1">
            Why Are Some Cards In Suits, While Others Aren't?
        </p>
        <p class="para1">
            If you've taken a good look at your cards, you will have noted that some have distinct names and are
            numbered zero to 21 (or one to 22, depending on the deck), while others that appear numbered in the same way
            that you might see in a traditional card deck, complete with aces, kings, and queens. The cards without
            suits make up the major arcana. Those that are labeled as belonging to swords, wands, cups, and pentacles
            comprise the minor arcana. A standard deck has 78 cards: 22 in the major arcana and 56 in the minor.
        </p>

        <p class="para1 subhead1">
            What's In The Major Arcana?
        </p>
        <p class="para1">
            The major arcana is made up of cards that directly represent archetypes, and suggest major themes and
            lessons that the querent (the subject of the reading) should pay attention to.


        </p>
        <p class="para1">
            There are many cards in your deck that symbolize impending change. If cards from the major arcana—think
            Death, or The Tower—show up, that means that the changes are going to be big, important, and an opportunity
            for a life-altering lesson.
        </p>
        <p class="para1">
            Of course, not all of the cards that comprise the major arcana are created equal. Depending on your deck—and
            they are available in increasing, and increasingly creative, numbers—some card names may be altered. Be sure
            to read up on your deck to catch all of its idiosyncrasies.



        </p>
        <p class="para1 subhead1">
            What's In The Minor Arcana?
        </p>
        <p class="para1">
            The minor arcana represents the joys, triumphs, hopes, fears, annoyances, and challenges we experience every
            day. The word "minor" doesn't imply that these issues aren't important; it just means that they're more
            temporary and less far-reaching than those you'll see in the major arcana cards. They're also easier to act
            upon.
        </p>
        <p class="para1">
            The minor arcana is separated into four suits—wands, swords, cups, and pentacles, traditionally—and each
            suit relates to a facet of human experience. Wands represent action and motivation; swords represent thought
            processes and decision-making; cups represent feelings and emotions; and pentacles represent the material
            world, as in work and finances.
        </p>
        <p class="para1">
            Some decks may mix this up, but the meanings generally remain the same.

        <p class="para1 subhead1">
            Ready For A Reading?
        </p>
        <p class="para1">
            This crash course has been leading toward a simple goal, a readiness to give yourself—or soon, perhaps
            others—a reading. If you've heard that it's bad form to read for yourself, know this is a myth. In fact,
            using the cards to gain insight and is one of the quickest ways to start getting honest with yourself—all it
            takes is a simple shuffle.
        </p>
        <p class="para1">
            There are a variety of Tarot spreads to try. And while it may be tempting to lay out a ten-card Celtic
            Cross, it's best to begin with something a bit more basic, though equally powerful. A three-card spread is
            both illuminating and versatile.


        </p>
        <p class="para1 subhead1">
            A Three-card Spread How-to:

            <div>
                <span>1</span>
            </div>
            <p class="para1">Begin by shuffling the deck while contemplating your question. You may want to cut your
                shuffled deck into three piles and then reassemble it before pulling your cards, or you may not—do what
                feels right. Likewise, you may want to spread the cards out face down and move them around before
                picking, rather than splitting the deck. How you shuffle is entirely up to you—the most important aspect
                is your unwavering concentration on the question you want answered.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="last-container">
            <div>
                <span>2</span>
            </div>
            <p class="para1">Pull three cards off the top of the deck, and position them to be read from left to right.
                This spread may seem simple, but it's also very versatile. You can use the cards to denote past,
                present, and future, or, situation, action, and outcome. If you're doing a relationship reading, you can
                even designate the first card as yourself, the second as your partner (or potential partner), and the
                third as the relationship between you both. Just don't change the parameters of the inquiry mid-reading!
            </p>
        </div>
        <p class="para1 para2-2">
            Don't worry if you don't know the meanings of all the cards yet—there are 78 of them, after all. A big part
            of reading the Tarot is building up your own intuition. Master the keywords associated with each card—use
            your booklet or the web for reference—and remember that the illustrations are there for a reason, and likely
            a factor that drew you to your deck! Look at the cards closely, notice how they relate to one another—look
            for connections; They should tell a story. Most importantly, don't worry about perfection. Time, practice,
            and an open mind will serve you well on this journey.


        </p>
        <div class="last-container">
            <div>
                <span>3</span>
            </div>
            <p class="para1">Now, press pause your research, shuffle your deck, and pull a three-card spread. You're
                well on your way to reading the Tarot like a true seer.

                <h2> Tarot Cards and Common Descriptions</h2>
                <img src="tarot1.jpeg">
                <h3>Strength</h3>
                <p>The modern interpretation of the card by most tarot readers stresses discipline and control. The lion
                    represents the primal or id-like part of the mind, and the woman, the 'higher' or more elevated
                    parts of the mind. The card tells the querent to be wary of base emotions and impulse.</p>
                <img src="tarot2.jpeg">
                <h3>The Empress</h3>
                <p>The Empress is a mother, creator, and nurturer and can represent the creation of life, romance, art,
                    or business. Tarot readers may interpret The Empress card as the germination of an idea before it is
                    ready to be fully born. The Empress is also often interpreted to be Demeter, goddess of abundance.
                    She is the giver of earthly gifts, although at the same time, she can be overprotective and
                    possessive.</p>
                <img src="tarot3.jpeg">
                <h3>The Devil</h3>
                <p>This card can mean that a person is stuck, co-dependent, fearful, or even trapped in bondage to
                    addiction. It may represent that the person is operating on base instincts with their own selfish
                    lust in mind, without regard for others' welfare.</p>
                <img src="tarot4.jpeg">
                <h3>The Tower</h3>
                <p>This card is considered an ill omen by some, but most tarot readers look at it as an indication that
                    present circumstances must be cleared away in order for new beginnings to emerge.</p>
                <img src="tarot5.jpeg">
                <h3>The Magician</h3>
                <p>The card can mean that a manipulator is floating around, usually if it's reversed. He may be a
                    beneficent guide, but he does not necessarily have our best interests in mind. He may also represent
                    the querent’s ego or self-awareness. He can also represent the intoxication of power, both good and
                    bad.</p>
